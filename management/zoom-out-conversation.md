# Zoom Out Conversations

Do this with your team members once per quarter:

The objective of a Zoom Out conversation is to pause from the day-to-day and explore opportunities for professional growth and enrichment. Aim to have a Zoom Out every fiscal quarter. You can ponder these prompts solo first or discuss directly with your manager: 

1. Strengths and Sparks: What work comes naturally to you? What kinds of tasks or topics get you fired up? 

2. Optimal Conditions: When do you produce your best work - solo or collaboratively, structured or flexible, tight timelines or long-range projects? What workplace elements bring out your A-game?

3. Career Spotlights: Currently, what are your top 3 priorities career-wise - challenge, variety, work-life balance, compensation, status, meaning, responsibility, mastery? What drew you to these aims?

4. Horizon Goals: Any longer-term professional aspirations percolating, even if not fully defined yet? What sparks your interest looking ahead? No need to have a set career plan!

5. Growth Zone: What's one area you most want to develop right now? On a 1-10 scale, how skilled are you here currently? What type of feedback would be useful? On a 1-10 scale, how satisfied are you with your professional growth and enrichment currently? How can I further support your development?

Wrap up your Zoom Out chat by deciding on next steps, like making small role adjustments to optimize strengths, checking on development goals regularly, or taking on a stretch assignment to build skills in your growth zone.

The key is stepping back from the daily grind to gain perspective on priorities, passions, and possibilities for enriching your role over time. Zoom Out conversations cultivate engagement, innovation and purpose.
